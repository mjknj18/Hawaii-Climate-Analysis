# Hawaii-Climate-Analysis



## Questions

### Climate Analysis

#### Precipitation Analysis

1. How much total precipitation did Hawaii receive during the last twelve months on record?
2. What are the summary statistics for that precipitation data?

#### Weather Station Analysis

1. What are the most active weather stations by observation count?
2. What are the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures for the most active weather station?

#### Temperature Analysis

1. For the most active weather station, what are the most common temperature observations for the last twelve months on record?
2. Are the means of the recorded June temperature data and December temperature data statistically significant?

#### Historical Analysis

1. Given a set of vacation dates, what are the historical maximum, minimum, and average temperatures for the same date range one year prior?
2. Given a set of vacation dates, what is the total rainfall for each weather station for the same date range one year prior?
3. Given a set of vacation dates, what are the daily normal maximum, minimum, and average temperatures for the same date range for all years on record?

### Climate API

#### Static Routes

1. How much total precipitation did Hawaii receive during the last twelve months on record?
2. What are the ID numbers and names of the weather stations collecting climate data?
3. What are the temperatures observed by all Hawaii weather stations during the last twelve months on record?

#### Dynamic Routes

1. For a given start date, what are the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures for all dates on and beyond that date?
2. For a given start and end date combination, what are the maximum, minimum, and average temperatures for all dates between those dates inclusive?
